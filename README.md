## Birth
At first, my purpose of creating this project was designing a simple graphical user interface;
I wanted to make a PC app that contains a simple GUI and some primary codes...
So I started and when I finished programming, I felt that I can learn a lot of things by developing this program and improve myself, so I started developing and I put it in GitHub.

## Introduction
This PC app called "Average Calculator" can calculate the average of several numbers, no matters how much are they!
This program contains a GUI (Graphical User Interface) designs with Qt and some source codes written with python.

## How to run
If you want to develop it or see its source codes, you can open the "runner.py" with your favorite IDE and run it.
But if you want to run the program as an EXE file, you can install the `pyinstaller` package and convert the `app.py` to an EXE file using `pyinstaller`; Or you can even use `auto-py-to-exe` to do this more comfortably.
More details about running this program will be considered in the next update of this README file.

## Used tools
- **Programming language**: Python
- **GUI**: Qt5

## TODO
- [x] Add back and forward options.
- [x] Fix a bug related to the program's icon.
- [ ] Put every widgets in an organized table layout.
